# ðŸ¤–ChatBot


## Install requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: this application requires Python 3.7.

## Standalone
```bash
path_to_python3.7_exec pd-chatbot\bot.py 
```

## Socket
First run the socket server program. 
```bash
path_to_python3.7_exec pd-chatbot\socket\server.py 
```
Then, in another terminal, run the socket client program.
```bash
path_to_python3.7_exec pd-chatbot\socket\client.py 
```
Now just write the input in the client program and wait for the server (the chatbot) to respond.

## RPC
Running the RPC implementation is similar to what was described above for Socket. In a terminal, we first run the server.
```bash
path_to_python3.7_exec pd-chatbot\rpc\server.py 
```
Then, in another terminal, we run the client.
```bash
path_to_python3.7_exec pd-chatbot\rpc\client.py 
```
Same as the Socket version, inputs are made on the client side; wait for the bot response via RPC server.
